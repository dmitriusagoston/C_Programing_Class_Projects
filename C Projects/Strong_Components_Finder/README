List.c - File containing the list ADT.

List.h - Header file for the list ADT.

Graph.c - File containing the graph ADT.

Graph.h - Header file for the graph ADT.

GraphTest.c - File containing test harness for the graph ADT.

FindComponents.c - File containing code that given a correctly formated
infile will find the strongly connect components of the graph.

Note: The function visit() uses time as an input output variable from DFS() since time is defined locally in DFS().
pa2 was used in pa3 by reusing the list ADT along with the Graph ADT, though the Graph ADT had unecessary
functions removed and the necessary ones for DFS() implemented.
